# Design Document - "Fuel Consumption and Interval Data Management Database"

By [Yurii]

## Scope

This database aims to manage and analyze vehicle fuel consumption based on interval data logs, recording periods of parking and movement, timestamps, fuel levels, and additional metadata such as location.

### Functional Requirements

This database will support:

- Creating and managing vehicle profiles
- Recording interval data (parking/moving)
- Logging fuel levels and timestamps
- Tracking location data
- Generating reports on fuel consumption

### Entities and Relationships

#### ER Diagram

(Include a diagram showing relationships between entities)

### Entities

- **Vehicles Table**: 
  - One-to-Many with Intervals Table

- **Intervals Table**: 
  - Many-to-One with Vehicles Table
  - One-to-Many with Locations Table (optional)

- **Locations Table**: 
  - Many-to-One with Intervals Table

Testing and Debugging

    Data Entry: Enter test data for vehicles, intervals, and locations.
    Query Testing: Verify that views and queries return correct results.
    Optimization: Check indexing efficiency and query performance.

Documentation and Presentation

    Database Structure: Describe entities, attributes, and relationships.
    SQL Schema: Provide detailed SQL schema and sample data.
    Queries and Views: Document key queries and views used in the database.
    Presentation: Prepare slides to explain the database design, implementation, and results.
